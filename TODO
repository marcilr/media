"Wouldn't it be easier to run an android image in a virtual machine
and just use the android netflix app?"

x Sat Oct 30, 2010 - The utility to use for drive inspection is
the hardinfo package:

hardinfo - Displays system information

It displays Devices > Storage with the WD Ext HDD 1021 details.
Very Nice.

Initially dmesg only reports:
usb 3-2: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 13
usb 3-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
scsi13 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
usb-storage: device found at 13
usb-storage: waiting for device to settle before scanning
usb 3-2: New USB device found, idVendor=1058, idProduct=1021
usb 3-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
usb 3-2: Product: Ext HDD 1021
usb 3-2: Manufacturer: Western Digital
usb 3-2: SerialNumber: 5743415A4130353630373431

Waiting a few 10s of seconds dmesg reports:
scsi 13:0:0:0: Direct-Access     WD       Ext HDD 1021     2002 PQ: 0 ANSI: 4
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] 3907024896 512-byte hardware sectors (2000397 MB)
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] Test WP failed, assume Write Enabled
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] Assuming drive cache: write through
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] 3907024896 512-byte hardware sectors (2000397 MB)
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] Test WP failed, assume Write Enabled
sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] Assuming drive cache: write through
sdd: sdd1 sdd2 sdd3 sdd4

Need to know the right tool to display succinct list of drive and mount 
points.  In particular want too know all usb and sata drives attached to 
system.
