Streacom


As best I can tell HDPLEX does not currently sell 
a fanless box with ODD and PCIe slot - ouch.

Streacom appears to make a few

Ideally you want 2x PCIe slots:
  1x NVMe 4 slot card
  1x Ceton InfiniTV 4 PCIe

=============================
Found a 2-foot square box in the foryear today
that must be the two Streacom FC10 Alpha Fanless Chassis 
I purchased.  Need to open and inspect.
