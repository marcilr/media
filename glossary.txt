DVR - A digital video recorder (DVR), sometimes referred to by the merchandising term 
  personal video recorder (PVR), is a consumer electronics device or application software 
  that records video in a digital format to a disk drive, USB flash drive, SD memory card
  or other local or networked mass storage device.

FLAC - stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless,
  meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.  This is similar to how
  Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better compression because it is designed
  specifically for audio, and you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player
  (or your car or home stereo, see supported devices) just like you would an MP3 file.

H.264 - H.264/MPEG-4 Part 10 or AVC (Advanced Video Coding) is a standard for video compression,
  and is currently one of the most commonly used formats for the recording, compression, and
  distribution of high definition video.

  H.264 is perhaps best known as being one of the codec standards for Blu-ray Discs; all Blu-ray
  Disc players must be able to decode H.264. It is also widely used by streaming internet sources,
  such as videos from Vimeo, YouTube, and the iTunes Store, web software such as the Adobe Flash
  Player and Microsoft Silverlight, and also various HDTV broadcasts over terrestrial (ATSC,
  ISDB-T, DVB-T or DVB-T2), cable (DVB-C) and satellite (DVB-S and DVB-S2).

HTPC - "A Home Theater PC (HTPC) or Media Center is a convergence device that combines some 
  or all the capabilities of a personal computer with a software application that supports 
  video, photo, and music playback, and sometimes digital video recorder functionality. In 
  recent years, other types of consumer electronics, including gaming systems and dedicated 
  media devices have crossed over to manage video and music content. The term "media center" 
  also refers to specialized application software designed to run on standard personal 
  computer."

MVC - Multimedia Video Controller

MKV - "...is a flexible, open standard video file format that has quickly become the
  preferred file extension for high definition video on the Internet. It natively supports
  features like alternate audio tracks, multilingual subtitles and chapter points, as well
  as rich metadata authoring including cover art, ratings, descriptions and more. These features
  made it the perfect choice for DivX Plus HD video, allowing us to create an ideal viewing
  experience."

  "An MKV file is a Matroska file. Matroska is an open source container format. It is an
  alternative to the popular AVI and MP4 formats and it also surpasses them in many areas."

STD - A set-top box (STB) or set-top unit (STU) is an information appliance device that 
  generally contains a tuner and connects to a television set and an external source of 
  signal, turning the signal into content which is then displayed on the television screen 
  or other display device.

tor - The second-generation onion router
  tor is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication service.  Users choose a
  source-routed path through a set of nodes, and negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the 
  network, in  which each node  knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. 
  Traffic flowing down the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node,  which  
  reveals the down stream node.

VortexBox is a free, open source (GPL v3), quick-install ISO that turns your unused computer into 
  an easy-to-use music server/jukebox.  Once VortexBox has been loaded on an unused PC, it will 
  automatically rip CDs to FLAC and MP3 files, ID3 tag the files , and download the cover art. 
  Vortexbox will then serve the files to network media players such as Logitech Squeezebox, Sonos, 
  or Linn.  The music files can also be streamed to a Windows or Mac OSX system.
