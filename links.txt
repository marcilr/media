Ask Slashdot: How To Make My Own Hardware Multimedia Player?
Posted by timothy on Saturday April 07, @05:37PM
from the many-have-tried dept.
This article has some greate info and details:
o XBMC
o DLNA sucks donkey dick.
o ARM just isn't fast enough to bitbang stuff like h.264 HD encoding in realtime.
o ARM will struggle to do 1080p60 playback (if it can do it at all).
o ARM-based depends upon hardware acceleration and custom chips.

FLAC - stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar to MP3, but lossless,
meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC without any loss in quality.  This is similar to how 
Zip works, except with FLAC you will get much better compression because it is designed 
specifically for audio, and you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite player 
(or your car or home stereo, see supported devices) just like you would an MP3 file.
