be the best Android package.  Recording here.

Package Includes:
================
1x Minix Neo U1 Android TV Box
1x IR-Remote
1x 5V(3A) US Power Adapter
1x HDMI Cable
1x User Manual
1x A2 Lite Remote Control
--amazon


Applications
============
A variety of apps come pre-installed on the MINIX NEO U1 such as:
  Airpin Pro
  Airdroid
  Netflix
  Kodi 15.2

Airpin Pro acts as a media center of sorts, offering DLNA and Airplay functionality.
I was pretty impressed when I tried Airplay from my iPhone 6 and I was able to stream
music, movies and even mirror my display without issue.

OTA updates are supported for easy firmware updates via the MINIX OTA Updater app.
The app will download and install the latest update, making the whole process painless.
MINIX have already released a number of firmware updates (the latest at the time of
writing was released on the 30th of January).

The Amlogic S905 handles Android 5.1 well.  During my testing, navigating the UI was
smooth without any hitches.  The box isn't rooted but methods are available.

The MINIX NEO U1 comes with stock Kodi 15.2 pre-installed. However, MINIX recommends
that XBMC MINIX Edition which can be downloaded from their site.  It looks like stock
Kodi 15.2 with a custom splash screen but I'm guessing most of the changes are under
the hood.

Excellent Android TV box and remote

Fantastic Android TV box.
Very stable and is extremely optimized for video streaming.
Build quality is excellent and the box runs very cool.
A customized version of KODI is preloaded and the MINIX interface is simple and clean.
The A2 remote is an absolute joy to use.  It's a remote, a keyboard and a mouse all in one and so is
well worth the little extra over the NEO U1 alone.

AWESOME TV MEDIA BOX!!! RUNS GREAT WITH KODI!!!

Have had this a couple of weeks. I also have the most expensive android tv box and I like this one better.
Here is why...It runs a straight android system so you can add apps from the play store.  I use this as a
media player.  It handles 4 k streaming which is the most demanding.  I particularly like to use google
photos and music and Spotify.  The box software is excellent.  The manufacturer fully supports the box
and is available to help.  Updates are easy and the box is real easy to use and set up was a breeze.
It's worth the money.  Kodi works flawlessly on the box.  I recommend a good build installed on a separate
app and leave the native Kodi app alone for file snstalled by the manufacturer.  I highly recommend the
air remote.
